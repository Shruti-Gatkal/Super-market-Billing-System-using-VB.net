# Super-market-Billing-System-using-VB.net
I have developed a desktop software for the billing purpose of a super-market or a Grocery store. To develop GUI & build the project, I used Visual studio 2013 IDE. This whole project was developed in VB.net programming language. For data handling purpose, I used MS Acceess database management system. To build communication bridge between application & data source, I used OLEDB (Object linking & embedding database) Connection.
In this project, user is owner/worker of the store who can perform operation like create a new bill, view old bills, Manage & check grocery stock, Add new items in grocery stock data. here autheticaton is also provided with password to authenticate user login. This project will help to manage billing & stock maintaing oprrations of a store.
